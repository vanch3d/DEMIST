========================================================================


EXTERNAL REPRESENTATIONS
- Add an icon in each ER in order to signify the Translation level (DONE)
- ACTION and HYPOTHESIS should broadcast their reaction during the modifications (DONE)

WELCOME ER
- In learning mode, this ER should be opened and put to the front at the begining of EVERY LU 
- Learner should read it before starting the LU (add a button to start it on the ER)

CONTROLLER
- Try to prevent the Controller to be closed when a LU is activated (?)
- after a BP is done and the simulation restart, the Task button should disapear (DONE)
- Inactivate the review buttons as long as the task is not read
- Reduce the sizes of the Initial Conditions in the Controller (DONE)

PIE/BAR CHART
- Try to use different pattern (brush) for the same information that belong to different ExpSet

XY-GRAPH
- Try to implement a more readable/usefull scaling procedure (DONE)
- Slow down the simulation in Learning Mode (DONE)

MODELS
- No DOUBLING TIME in SSLG

INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN
- Implement a Cut & Paste operation between LUs and across files (DONE)
- Think about a reordering of the LUs in the scenario

AUTHORING PILOTS
- Reduce the Caterpillar bitmaps and change the Caterpillar component from logarithmic to linear one (DONE)
- complexify the different scenarios (in term of ERs) but keep them limited to 3 (DONE)
- In the Barnacles, use Prediction BP instead of Information (DONE)
